"""
Simplest demo performing Bayesian optimization on a one-dimensional test
function. This script also demonstrates user-defined visualization via a
callback function that is imported from the advanced demo.

The `pybo.solve_bayesopt()` function returns a numpy structured array, called
`info` below, which includes the observed input and output data, `info['x']` and
`info['y']`, respectively; and the recommendations made along the way in
`info['xbest']`.

The `callback` function plots the posterior with uncertainty bands, overlaid
onto the true function; below it we plot the acquisition function, and to the
right, the evolution of the recommendation over time.
