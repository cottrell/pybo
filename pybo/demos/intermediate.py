"""
Demo performing Bayesian optimization on an objective function sampled from a
Gaussian process. This script also demonstrates user-defined visualization via
a callback function that is imported from the advanced demo.

Note that in this demo we are sampling an objective function from a Gaussian
process. We are not, however, modifying the default GP used internally by
`pybo.solve_bayesopt`. The default model used within `pybo.solve_bayesopt` is a
GP with constant mean, Matern 5 kernel, and hyperparameters marginalized using
MCMC. To modify this behavior see the advanced demo.

In this demo we also explore the following additional Bayesian optimization
modules that can be user-defined:
  - the initial search grid,
  - the selection policy,
  - the recommendation strategy, and
  - composite kernels (a `pygp` feature).
